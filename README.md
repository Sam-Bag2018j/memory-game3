# memory-game3

This is a small progect called memory game to test the memory of users. It is the scond assignment of Nanodegree Front-End Web developer. You have to flip any two cards you think they are the same. If they match it, continue the other cards until all the cards are match it. There are a count down timer, number of movements and stars rating. When game finish it, there is a dialogue show how many stars you deserve it depends on the timer. you can reset the game at any time by clicking on reset button.

## What do you need:
* css, html and javascript editor.
* How to play the game
* user has to remember the location of cards and match the two similar cards quickly in short time

## How I built memory game
* I used Vigual Code to write Javascript,html,css

* I create container to holds all the cards

* there are two faces for each card, front cards and back cards.

* when user start the game only the front cards appear.

* once the user click on the first and second cards,the back cards appear only, and check if they match it or not

* if back cards match it,they will not flip it again

* if unmatch it, they will flip it to show front cards again.

* the user has to remember the location of cards to finish the game quickly.

* there is dialogue appear when all the cards are match it to show star rating and number of movements
